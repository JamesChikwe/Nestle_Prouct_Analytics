### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- As “Milo” is the best performing product, consider introducing promotions to boost sales with this product even more.
- For the underperforming “Nescafé Gold” product, evaluate pricing or marketing strategies to identify areas for improvement.
- Holiday Promotions:— As December been the month with the lowest sales, offer special promotions or discount during the holiday season to incentivize customers to purchase Nestlè product as gifts or for holiday gatherings.
- Limited - Time Offers:— Introduce limited - time offers or seasonal varieties of Nestlè products specifically for December, to create a sense of urgency and encourage purchases.
- Online Promotions and Social Media Campaigns:— Utilize social media platforms and online advertising to promote Nestlè products, including targeted ads, sponsored posts and engaging content related to holiday festivities.
- Review the pricing and promotional strategies in Western Australia and make adjustments as needed.
- Research the market in Western Australia to better understand consumer needs and preferences.
